    <h3 class="mt-5">0. Overview</h3>
    <p class="ps-3">
      As part of my co-op at SFU Graduate Studies(2023 Aug- 2024 Aug), I collaborated with the Indigenous Graduate Initiatives team to design promotional materials for the 2024 Indigenous Graduate Student Symposium (IGSS). This included creating a poster and an informational program PDF that aligned with the event's theme and communication goals.

    <!-- My Role -->
    <h3 class="mt-5">1. My Role</h3>
    <p><b> Graphic Designer · Internal Collaboration · Visual Communication</b></p>
    <p class="ps-3">
      I created visual assets—including a poster and a detailed program notice—based on the concept provided by the Indigenous Initiatives team. While my supervisor supported the overall direction, I independently led visual development, coordinated revisions through email, and ensured deadlines were met—all while managing other internal tasks and communications.
    </p>

    <!-- Design Decision -->
    <h3 class="mt-5">2. Design Decision</h3>
    <p class="ps-3">
      To redesign the IGSS poster, I started with the original version provided by the Indigenous Initiatives team. I restructured the layout to enhance clarity, adjusting the text hierarchy, spacing, and alignment to better highlight the event details while preserving the visual tone and cultural elements of the original.</p>
    <p class="ps-3">
      For the program information PDF, I initially had no prior reference, which made it difficult to know where to begin. After discussing with my supervisor, I reviewed sample materials and identified key priorities for layout and content structure. This helped me design a document that clearly communicated essential information in a clean and accessible way.

      Both materials were approved and distributed internally to promote the 2024 Indigenous Graduate Student Symposium. The final poster reflected a balanced visual update, and the program PDF helped clarify session details and logistics for attendees.

    <!-- Takeaway -->

    <p class="ps-3">
      This project taught me the importance of expectation management and communication in time-sensitive collaborative work. While juggling other daily tasks, I initially rushed through early drafts to meet deadlines. However, I learned that setting realistic boundaries, confirming delivery timelines, and clarifying expectations early on are essential to producing quality outcomes—especially when working with external partners.
